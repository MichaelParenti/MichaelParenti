### About Me

<img align="left" src="my-pic.png" alt="image not found" width="150" style="border: 20px solid  black;">

<div>
As one who is always seeking to optimize and create new technologies, I love to build interfaces that maximize the positive experiences of each user. With a strong focus on front-end engineering, I commonly use HTML, CSS, JS, and React. However, I am also familiar with using PHP, Linux scripting, and APIs to complete full-stack applications. As one who regularly works with troubleshooting sound systems, networks, software, and websites, I am consistently working to improve my troubleshooting and problem-solving skills. Whenever there is a better approach possible, I do my best to create amazing applications that will engage users by the simplicity of a professional, navigable interface.
